# Privacy Policy for OCR Combi Add-on

**Last Updated:** June 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "OCR Combi" Google Workspace Add-on ("the Add-on") handles your data. Our fundamental principle is that **the Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to the developer's servers.** All processing happens entirely within your own Google Account.

### Data We Access (Read-Only)

To function, the Add-on requires permission to access certain data. This access is used solely for the features you explicitly trigger:

*   **Selected File Metadata:** The Add-on reads the name, ID, and type of the files you select in Google Drive to identify which files are images and which are `[OCR]` documents.
*   **Selected Image Content:** The content of the image files you select is sent directly to Google's own Optical Character Recognition (OCR) service to extract text. This data is not seen or stored by the developer.
*   **Content of Selected Google Docs:** The Add-on reads the text content of the `[OCR]` documents you select in order to combine them.
*   **User's Language Setting:** The Add-on checks your language preference (e.g., "en" or "nl") to display the user interface in the correct language.

### Data We Create

*   **New Google Documents:** The Add-on creates new Google Documents in your Drive. These documents contain the text extracted from your images or the combined text from your selected documents. These files are owned by you and are stored in your Google Drive.

### Data We Do Not Access or Store

*   The Add-on **does not** have access to any files you have not explicitly selected.
*   The Add-on **does not** store any of your data on any non-Google server.
*   The Add-on **does not** share any of your data with third-party services, other than the Google services required for its operation (Drive API, Docs API).
