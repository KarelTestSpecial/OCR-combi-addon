# Terms of Service for OCR Combi Add-on

**Last Updated:** June 28, 2025

By installing and using the "OCR Combi" Google Workspace Add-on ("the Add-on"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.

### 1. Description of Service

The Add-on is a tool designed to help users convert image files to text and combine text from multiple Google Docs within their own Google Drive. The Add-on operates entirely within the user's Google Account and relies on Google's own services (Google Drive API, Google Docs API, and Google's OCR technology).

### 2. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Add-on is provided **"as is"** and **"as available"** without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The developer does not guarantee that the Add-on will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that the results of the OCR process will be 100% accurate. The functionality and availability of the Add-on are dependent on the continued availability of the underlying Google services.

### 3. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the developer be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to, loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, arising out of the use or inability to use the Add-on, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. You are solely responsible for your data and for backing up your files.

### 4. Changes to Terms

The developer reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. Your continued use of the Add-on after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
